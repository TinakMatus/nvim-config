## Neovim - Experimental Config

This is just my personal Neovim configuration that I am currently experimenting with. I wanted to see if I could build my own lightweight environment from scratch using Lua and so far it is working out pretty well.

It is a very simple setup right now. I am mostly focusing on keeping it fast and clean while I look for more useful features and plugins that I could add to make it even better.


It is still a work in progress but it already handles everything I need for my daily coding tasks without all the bloat of a normal IDE. I am also still practicing and learning all the Vim motions so I can eventually be even more productive and faster with my workflow.

"Still building, still experimenting."
